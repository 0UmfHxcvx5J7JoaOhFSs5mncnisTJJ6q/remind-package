\begin{abstract}
We compare the effectiveness of emissions quantity vs. intensity targets to prepare countries for progressive climate action under the Paris Agreement. The Agreement requires countries to submit interim targets every five years and in addition calls for submission of long term strategies until 2050. This study conducts a multi-criteria comparison of adopting a quantity vs. intensity target in 2030 followed by a quantity target in 2050 for the case of China. It explicitly considers economic growth uncertainty as it is the main motivation behind China’s and other developing countries’ adoption of emission intensity targets for 2030. First, we show that if China wants to hedge against higher than expected growth it should adopt an intensity target, but in case of lower than expected growth this choice becomes problematic. Furthermore, variation in climate policy costs related to the choice of interim target can be of the same order of magnitude as the climate policy costs themselves. Second, by use of a multi-criteria comparison we show that an interim quantity target performs better than an interim intensity target for China. We perform the comparison analytically, as well as using the stochastic version of a technology-rich integrated assessment model. The stochastic model is based on expected utility theory and explicitly accounts for uncertainty.\\

\section{Introduction}

With the contribution of China and India, more than one third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently controlled by targets indexed to future gross domestic product (GDP). This means that instead of aiming to achieve an absolute amount of yearly emissions by a given year, China and India aim for a reduction of the emission intensity of their economy, i.e. CO\textsubscript{2} emissions per unit of GDP by 2030 (current policy under the Paris Agreement). In climate policy design, emission intensity targets are used as alternatives to emission quantity targets to hedge against economic growth uncertainty, which is particularly large in rapidly developing countries like China and India. Recent research (\citet{ipcc_global_2018},\citet{luderer_residual_2018}) shows that the next decade of mitigation action until 2030 will determine the chances of staying below the warming limits set out in the Paris Agreement. Thus, it is important to explore the implications of the choice of target type in 2030 in preparing the economy and energy system for mid-century (2050) targets, toward the Paris ambition of holding global mean warming well below 2 \degree C. We do so here for the world's largest emitter, China, applying a state-of-the-art stochastic energy-economy model that explicitly accounts for economic growth uncertainty.

China is currently implementing its first emissions trading system---the first one globally formulated with an emissions intensity cap instead of an absolute cap \citep{goulder_chinas_2017}. It also takes measures to reduce air pollution, and invests heavily in renewables. Yet, these actions alone are not sufficient to rapidly decarbonize the Chinese economy, simply due to the country's sheer size, and its dependence on coal, which is in line with the world being still highly dependent on coal \citep{edenhofer_reports_2018}. While global coal demand dropped in 2015 for the first time this century, the International Energy Agency forecasts that demand will increase again and will not return to 2014 levels until 2021 \citep{iea/oecd_iea/oecd_2018}. Since China currently accounts for 50\% of global coal demand, and almost half of coal production, global coal demand in the next decade will depend greatly on the trajectory of China, itself highly uncertain, like the future economic growth of China.

Finally, economic growth has been identified as the most important indicator to which climate mitigation scenarios are sensitive \citep{marangoni_sensitivity_2017}. In the presence of a target indexed by growth this effect is strengthen even more. It is expected to intensify further with growing regional rivalry in trade \citep{neuenkirch_impact_2015}.

Motivated by the above, we address the following research question. An intensity or a quantity target for 2030 performs better in preparing the Chinese economy for the mid-century strategy and ultimately the 2 \degree C target? Acknowledging that a growth-indexed target will change drastically depending on economic output we conduct the analysis under explicit accounting for growth uncertainty by deploying a state-of-the-art stochastic integrated assessment model.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives a short overview of how the two target types and target sequencing emerge in the Paris process, section 3 provides a literature review on the comparison of intensity versus quantity targets, and section 4 describes the scenarios and methods we use for the present comparison. Section 5 begins the target comparison using an analytical approach and shows results of deterministic and stand-alone target scenarios, which motivate the stochastic sequencing scenario results, on which the final target comparison is based. Section 6 concludes. In the Appendix a description of the models used in the study is provided i.a., as well as a literature review on uncertainty consideration in energy-economy models of climate change.

\section{NDCs and target sequencing after Paris}

In the process of the 2015 UNFCCC Conference of the Parties in Paris, participating countries had to announce what would be their NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) in emission reductions until 2030. Apart from the variance in the level of ambition between countries, there is distinction also in the chosen types of the NDC targets. Most developed countries chose a quantity (or "absolute", both terms will be used throughout the paper) target, aiming to reduce domestic emissions by a fixed amount (compared to a base-year, e.g. 2005), as the final Paris Agreement text suggested \citep{unfccc_paris_2015}. Developing countries, however, are advised by the Paris text to adopt intensity targets, i.e. reducing emissions per unit of GDP \citep{unfccc_paris_2015}. The economic reasoning behind choosing intensity targets is uncertainty about future economic growth. An intensity target $T$ can be seen as the hedging strategy against not achieving the desired reduction in absolute emissions $E$ because of unexpected accelerated growth in the economy, as the allowed emissions increase with faster economic growth $Y$:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:1}
T = \frac{E}{Y}\\
\end{equation}


It can also be the method to avoid hot-air, i.e. the absolute target becoming non-binding because of slow economic growth resulting in lower than expected emission output, as the amount of allowed emissions decreases with slower growth (Equation \ref{eq:1}), which can harm a country's credibility towards other participants of an agreement. Finally, there is also a political stance reflected in the choice of a target indexed to economic output; an acknowledgement that the willingness to act against climate change exists, but combined with a statement that penalizing growth of developing countries does not correctly reflect the responsibilities associated with historical emissions.

Notable examples of countries that adopted intensity targets include China (in continuation of its post-Copenhagen intensity targeting policies) and India, the two countries together totalling more than one third of global emissions. The main argument behind this choice is the aversion to any policy that could potentially slow down economic growth in developing countries, as intensity targets are believed to allow for growth of the economy and emissions at the same time. In contrast, quantity targets are believed to break that link \citep{pizer_case_2005}. However, intensity targets create skepticism, not least because of their use by the Bush administration as a response to the Kyoto Protocol after the decision not to ratify it, which---instead of reducing US emissions---could allow them to grow by 32\% until 2012 \citep{vuuren_evaluation_2002}. Apart from this notable example, intensity targets have found very limited use in the international climate negotiations until China and India decided to adopt them. Due to the special form of intensity targets, the choice of target type is particularly important; should it have large implications, then, although the number of countries choosing an intensity target is small, the impact in global decarbonization pathways will be large.

Progress made in the implementation of NDCs will be monitored, and reviewed every 5 years, beginning with a stock taking in 2018. Mid-century strategies are already being discussed, as countries are invited in the Paris text to submit their strategies for 2050 \citep{unfccc_paris_2015}. This means that once these mid-century targets are in place the NDCs will become intermediate targets, and a situation of target sequencing will emerge. Compatibility of NDCs and 2050 targets is an important issue and will play a decisive role in paving the way for long term climate stabilization (\cite{pahle_sequencing_2018}; \cite{kriegler_short_2018}). An analysis of the dynamics of this succession of targets under uncertainty is pursued in this study.


\section{The literature on target comparison}

We compare sequential intensity and absolute targets under economic growth and policy uncertainty. By "sequential" we mean an NDC target followed by a mid-century strategy. Intensity targets can be indexed to output or input and are well established in environmental regulation. They gained more attention in the climate context during the establishment and first stage of the Kyoto Protocol, and especially after the US Administration adopted an intensity target instead of ratifying the treaty, which was described by absolute targets. The post-Copenhagen debate---when it became clear that a Kyoto-like global agreement including underlying permit trading mechanisms was not achievable---focuses more on targets for individual countries and commitment discussions.

Overall, the scientific literature on comparison between intensity and absolute targets in environmental regulation is divided in two main categories: one that deals with economy-wide regulation, and one that addresses the issue at firm or sectoral level, see e.g. \citet{quirion_does_2005}. The focus of this paper will be the category of economy-wide regulation, which we divide further in 3 subcategories defined as follows: (I) analyses of policies for a specific country or region and discussion of which target performs better; (II) discussions of the implications of the target choice on international bilateral (or broader) agreements in terms of willingness to participate and commit; and (III) target sequencing, i.e. situations were in multi-stage policy design either choice of target can be implemented sequentially (including the cases of intermediate target updating as the baseline changes with time).

\citet{marschinski_revisiting_2010} discuss (I), (II) as well as (III) by use of formal analyses with simple analytic models, including also the concepts of hot-air in emission cuts and banking/borrowing of emission permits. They find intensity targets to perform better than absolute targets only under very specific conditions, like e.g. a significant positive correlation between shocks in emissions and output. \citet{ellerman_absolute_2003} also touch all 3 subcategories, and find hybrid targets including only some reduced form of indexation---which they analyze in detail---to have advantages over pure absolute or intensity targets, but conclude in making the case for willingness to act as being more important than the target type. 

In the subcategory of single country studies (I), \citet{lu_emissions_2013} analyze China's previous intensity targeting for 2020 and conclude that the advantage of flexibility offered by intensity targets is reduced by the prospect of a low growth scenario realising, which would incur high costs. \citet{wang_china_2014} asks for a Chinese shift to a total emissions cap in order to brake the link between emissions and growth. This is based on the grounds of an expected coal import increase under an intensity target following a reduction in coal usage in big coal exporting countries (e.g USA). \citet{zhu_road_2018} propose a hybrid control scheme based on quantity (energy consumption and CO\textsubscript{2} emissions) and intensity (energy intensity and carbon intensity) for the case of slow growth. \citet{webster_second-best_2010} also propose a hybrid instrument including a safety valve, and perform a Monte-Carlo analysis for the US economy with use of a CGE model. They include uncertainty in 3 parameters: GDP, the rate of autonomous energy efficiency improvement, and the elasticities of substitution of the production functions. Their analysis results in favoring the intensity targets depending on parameter values and only in combination with the safety valve instrument. \citep{pizer_case_2005} makes the case for intensity targets on the grounds of preserving developing countries' right to near-term emission growth. 

In the subcategory (II) of interacting participants in agreements, \citet{akimoto_global_2008} propose a scheme based on sectoral intensity targets, as opposed to land-specific ones, that reduces the overall energy transformation costs but they don't consider the welfare implications and don't account for uncertainty. \citet{dudek_intensity_2003} reject the concept of intensity targets arguing that it is a potential additional hurdle to the already difficult to achieve international agreements.

Authors address the subcategory of target sequencing (III) the least. \citet{sue_wing_absolute_2006} find intensity control more suitable under a broad range of emission targets, especially for developing countries. Their analysis is based on two indicators arising from consideration of uncertainty: preservation of expectations and temporal stability.

We contribute to the literature on China's climate and energy policy, as well as to the literature on comparison of intensity and absolute targets, by providing an analysis in which we explicitly account for uncertainty and include target sequencing. Additionally, in our study, the target comparison criteria found in the literature are extended.



\section{Study design}

As growth uncertainty is the motivation behind choosing an intensity target, in our modelling we use methods for explicitly accounting for uncertainty and learning. Moreover, to capture the importance of current targets in paving the way for future climate policy we consider target sequencing scenarios. Finally, since reduction of fossil resource use is crucial in shaping China's emissions future, we use a model of large technological detail, so as to capture realistic energy system configurations. Resulting from the above, an overview of the scenarios considered in our study is given on Table \ref{tab:scenarios}. Scenarios unfold in two dimensions: a) Learning about climate targets, and b) Learning about economic growth. More in detail, with the first dimension we consider different target types---or lack thereof---and years  where learning about the 2050 target occurs (i.e. stand-alone targets in 2030 with uncertainty about the 2050 target, or sequential targets: 2030 targets are known in 2010---the model time horizon's starting point---and in 2030 the 2050 target is announced). The second dimension represents different years where learning about economic growth occurs: 2010 or 2030. In the remaining section, the different scenario dimensions are explained in further detail. We run all scenarios with the integrated assessment model REMIND \citep{luderer_description_2015}, in its stochastic version called REMIND-S, which is presented here for the first time (see \ref{ap:remind} and \ref{ap:reminds} for the descriptions of REMIND and REMIND-S, respectively).


\subsection{Climate policy scenarios}

Sequencing scenarios are defined as scenarios where a 2 \degree C-compatible GHG emissions quantity\footnote{The long-term goal of 2 \degree C adopted by the Paris Agreement corresponds to a quantity target (i.e. an absolute limit on cumulative CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, not indexed by another quantity), we thus formulate the 2050 target solely as a quantity target, i.e. we do not consider 2050 intensity target scenarios.} reduction target in 2050 (mid-century strategy) is announced in 2030 (learning), which follows after the currently announced 2030 intensity target, or after an equivalent 2030 quantity target.

In contrast to the sequencing scenarios we also run "stand-alone" scenarios with the 2030 Chinese climate target formulated as either a GHG intensity or a GHG quantity target. These scenarios reflect the current situation, where only targets until 2030 are announced and there is uncertainty about the 2050 target, thus learning about targets is considered again to occur in 2030, see Table \ref{tab:scenarios}. We also consider a hypothetical scenario of full information: both the 2050 target and growth uncertainty are resolved in 2010. The latter is used to calculate the 2030 targets as explained in the next paragraph.

Due to the incompatibility of the Chinese NDC (characterized mainly by the target of reducing emissions intensity by 65\% compared to 2005) with 2 \degree C scenarios \citep{unep_emissions_2017}, our 2030 optimal intensity target is calculated as follows: under complete information, i.e. medium growth and known long-term target (the 2 \degree C target of the Paris Agreement), we derive the intensity target (INT from now on) of 0.91 Mt CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalents/billion US\$2005 that cost-efficiently complies with the long-term 2 \degree C target. A schematic of this is provided in Figure \ref{fig:derivet30target}, where it is seen that in order to derive the INT target we depart from the emissions in 2050 of the medium-growth cost-optimal 2 \degree C path for China (8.6 Gt CO\textsubscript{2}-equivalents, CO\textsubscript{2}eq from now on; derived from a global scenario that stays below 2 \degree C with medium likelihood, $>$50\%). We use the results of the CD-LINKS project \citep{kriegler_short_2018}. For target comparison, we then consider scenarios with a 2030 quantity target (QUAN from now on) that achieves the same GHG emissions as the intensity scenario. 

Climate policy in all scenarios is enforced via a lump-sum carbon tax, covering also CH\textsubscript{4} and N\textsubscript{2}O emissions, however excluding land-use change CO\textsubscript{2} emissions. The carbon tax takes an initial value in 2020 and then rises with a 5\% annual increase, and is applied on the whole economy. To derive the optimal carbon tax path, the model is solved iteratively (with updating of the initial carbon tax value between iterations) until the climate target, i.e. the reduction of GHG emissions or GHG intensity, is met.

\end{figure*}


\subsection{Economic growth scenarios}

Our central, medium growth scenario is based on SSP2 "middle-of-the-road" assumptions \citep{kriegler_new_2014} for the labor productivity\footnote{By designing the growth scenarios via labor productivity---instead of prescribing GDP paths---we capture macro-economic effects of different policy choices.} growth, the main driving force of economic growth in the REMIND model \citep{luderer_description_2015}. Then we consider one scenario with 25\% higher labor productivity growth ("High"), and one scenario with 25\% lower growth ("Low"). All three growth scenarios are equiprobable.

Figure \ref{fig:gdpscen} shows the resulting baseline GDP paths for China. Also shown are current growth estimates from 3 sources: the IMF, the OECD, and Price-Waterhouse-Coopers. Figure \ref{fig:gdpscen} illustrates the difficulty of deriving solid predictions of Chinese economic growth \citep{morgan_uncertainty_2018,christensen_uncertainty_2018}. It is also seen that our scenarios constitute a realistic uncertainty spread. 

\begin{figure*}[t]

A 25 per cent variation around the medium growth scenario (SSP2, O'Neill et al. 2014) is used for the labor efficiency parameter in our scenarios (Low, Medium, High). For reference, the SSP5 (based on OECD projections; Kriegler et al. 2017) as well as scenarios from the IMF (WEO, 2018), OECD (OECD, 2018), and Price-Waterhouse-Coopers (Hawksworth et al. 2018) are shown.}

\section{Results}

\subsection{The importance of target type choice}

\subsubsection{Analytical results}

We start with a comparision of simple stand-alone targets and a look into how hedging strategies emerge under growth uncertainty. We do so analytically in the present section and numerically in the next sections. Here we provide a discussion of how each target type shapes the optimal carbon tax differently. This is important because different incentives and investment dynamics are reflected in the optimal carbon price paths, and subsequently different hedging strategies against uncertainty (e.g. precautionary versus wait-and-see). We will show that when emission intensity decreases with economic growth---as is the case in China---the target type has a strong effect on how the growth scenarios shape the optimal carbon tax paths, i.e. different incentives for investment are generated. More precisely we show that in the presence of a quantity target the optimal carbon price increases with economic growth, whereas under an intensity target it decreases.

We define the emissions reduction in each case as $\Delta E\equiv E_{base}-E_{pol}$. In a single period setting (stand-alone target), and under an emissions quantity target $Q$, we get (comparing the medium with the low growth scenario):

\begin{equation}
\Delta E_M = E_{M,base}-Q > E_{L,base} -Q=\Delta E_L ,\\
\end{equation}

because $E_{M,base}>E_{L,base}$ (see Figure \ref{fig:ltaEmiInt}). Thus, we see that since abatement in the medium scenario is larger than in the in low scenario (the target $Q$ is fixed, but baseline emissions are higher under medium growth than under low growth), the medium scenario will feature a larger carbon price.

In the case of an intensity target $I$, we get ($Y$ stands for GDP):

\begin{equation} \label{eq:3}
\Delta E_L = E_{L,base}-I \cdot Y_{L,pol} = E_{M,base} \cdot \frac{E_{L,base}}{E_{M,base}}-I \cdot Y_{M,pol} \cdot \frac{Y_{L,pol}}{Y_{M,pol}}> E_{M,base}-I \cdot Y_{M,pol}=\Delta E_M \\
\end{equation}

The inequality in eq. \ref{eq:3} holds only if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
\frac{E_{L,base}}{E_{M,base}}>\frac{Y_{L,pol}}{Y_{M,pol}}\Rightarrow\frac{I_{L,base}}{I_{M,base}}\cdot\frac{Y_{L,base}}{Y_{M,base}}>  \frac{Y_{L,pol}}{Y_{M,pol}}\Rightarrow I_{L,base}>I_{M,base} \\
\end{equation}

(GDP cancels out, because $Y_{base}=Y_{pol}$; climate policy has very little impact on GDP). The last inequality of eq. \ref{eq:4} holds for China, because Chinese emissions grow with GDP, but with a slower rate than GDP, which means that emissions intensity decreases with economic growth, see Figure \ref{fig:ltaEmiInt}. Thus from eq. \ref{eq:3} it holds that $\Delta E_M < \Delta E_L$

Thus, in the presence of an intensity target the optimal carbon price will be highest for the low growth scenario, as seen also on Figure \ref{fig:carbonprice}. As the carbon price is a proxy for costs of policies, this has serious implications in how the hedging strategies of the early years are shaped, which we will quantify numerically in the following.

\end{figure}
 

\subsubsection{Numerical results}

To motivate the use of a stochastic modelling framework in the upcoming sections, we start the numerical analysis by investigating here the implications of deterministic modelling, i.e. of assuming that learning about growth uncertainty has occurred already in 2010 (LTA, see \ref{ap:uncscen}), and with stand-alone targets in 2030 (no information about the 2050 target and no target sequencing). We compare the medium with the high and low growth scenarios, and discuss environmental implications in terms of total GHG emissions and express differences in policy costs in terms of carbon taxes. Finally, we discuss welfare effects in terms of differences in \emph{balanced growth equivalents} (BGE from now on, proposed by \citet{stern_economics_2007}, and further analyzed and used by \citet{anthoff_impact_2009}, and \citet{drouet_climate_2016}, see \ref{ap:bge} for details on this cost metric).

The optimal emissions paths of the deterministic cases are given in Figure \ref{fig:ltaEmiInt}. In complete absence of uncertainty (medium growth and L10), it makes no difference whether an intensity or quantity target is chosen, which can be proven also analytically \citep{ellerman_absolute_2003}. Thus, optimal emissions are identical, as seen by the coinciding paths (black line). The fact that the paths are identical also proves that we compare equivalent targets. When we move from the medium growth scenario, i.e. in the high and low growth scenarios, the emissions of the respective target types are not the same. In detail: optimal paths show large deviations due to the emissions taking different values, depending on whether it is a INT or a QUAN target. If a higher than expected growth is observed, emissions will grow regardless of target choice, seen by the difference in the red and the black curves. An intensity target has increased emissions in total and in absolute value in 2030, whereas Q30-L10 meets the 2030 target of 13.4 Gt CO\textsubscript{2}eq but with increased total emissions. On the other hand, in the case of low growth a QUAN target exhibits hot-air; the target is not binding as the baseline emissions are already below it (strong blue line). This means that even in a moderately low growth scenario climate policy costs can drop to zero under a QUAN target. Finally, a INT target makes a low growth scenario become a stringent climate policy scenario (weak blue line).

In terms of policy costs, Figure \ref{fig:carbonprice} shows how high growth with a QUAN target can increase the carbon tax almost 3-fold, whereas a INT target has the opposite effect. On the other hand, in the low growth case, there is significant increase with T30I, whereas T30Q results in hot-air---i.e. no costs (the target is not binding as baseline emissions are already below it). Regarding the welfare effects, Table \ref{tab:tabLTA} shows how the differences in welfare between target types compare with each other and---for reference---with the costs of climate policy. In the case of high growth INT performs better than QUAN, whereas in the case of low growth only INT produces costs (as QUAN is not binding), so quantity has an advantage. In the medium growth case there is no difference in welfare, due to the equivalence of the two targets in the absence of uncertainty. It is important to note that the differences in welfare between the targets in the high and low growth scenarios could reach the same order of magnitude as the costs of climate policy (last two rows of Table \ref{tab:tabLTA}). This observation, combined with the case-dependent advantage that each target exhibits---depending on what growth scenario realises---motivates us to perform the stochastic analysis of the upcoming sections, in order to compare intensity and quantity targets.

\subsection{Target sequencing}\label{sec:tsequencing}

In the remaining paper we perform decision-making under uncertainty (ATL, NL, see \ref{ap:uncscen}), as opposed to the deterministic analysis of the previous section. We do so by taking into account all values of the uncertain parameter at once, thus deriving one single optimal path instead of 3 (one for each growth scenario), which is the main feature of the stochastic model. This allows us to identify hedging strategies (i.e. uncertainty-driven emission reductions, see Figure \ref{fig:uncoverview}), and helps overcome the limitations of the previous section. 

First, we discuss the case of target sequencing. We calculate the optimal emission paths for cases where, initially, decisions up to a certain point are taken with only the 2030 targets being known (stand-alone scenarios), and an announcement of  a "follow-up" 2050 quantity target takes place in the same year (myopic behavior). We simulate two types of sequencing scenarios, one that follows after the 2030 INT target case, which we denote with I30Q50-L30, and one that follows after the 2030 QUAN target case, which we denote with I30Q50-L30, see also Table \ref{tab:scenarios}. REMIND-S calculates the optimal paths that emerge around mid-century, resulting from investment decisions pre-2030 taken under growth uncertainty and without information about the follow-up 2050 target. 

In Figure \ref{fig:sequencing} we show how target sequencing shapes optimal emissions paths, and plot these next to the hypothetical case of a stand-alone target in 2050 (the Q50-L10-medium scenario features no growth uncertainty, and has full long-term target information; thus an intermediate target is obsolete). Due to the stronger hedging (i.e. the deviation from the Q50-L10-medium scenario, which we analyze in detail in the next sections) of the intensity target scenario, decarbonization starts earlier in the I30Q50-L30 scenario and thus total emissions (area under emissions curve) are lower than in the quantity case (483 Gt CO\textsubscript{2} in I30Q50-L30 vs. 527 Gt CO\textsubscript{2}eq in Q30Q50-L30). In Figure \ref{fig:sequencing2} a more detailed representation of the same scenarios is shown, focusing on key variables and adding the baseline scenario. An intensity target scenario has higher net present value (in year 2015) carbon taxes (27.7 \$/tCO\textsubscript{2} vs. 18.6 \$/tCO\textsubscript{2}). This leads to overinvestment in energy in the early years (energy investment curve). It can also lead to substantial early retirement of coal capacities in the power sector up to 2050 (aggregated over time), 2500 GW, i.e. nearly 40\% of total projected coal capacity in the baseline (6400 GW), and 66\% more than the idle capacity in the quantity target scenario. The stronger hedging has, however, the positive property of better protecting the economy for shocks, as seen by the lower volatility in the carbon tax paths after the year 2030, where target sequencing happens. Finally, a quantity target could lead to less welfare losses as seen in the \emph{balanced growth equivalent} curves.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/sequencing.pdf}
  \caption{Optimal emissions of the target sequencing scenarios (featuring uncertainty about growth and 2050 target until 2030), compared to the stand-alone medium-growth Q50 deterministic scenario (full information about 2050 target and economic growth). In 2030 uncertainty is resolved (learning point) and the 2050 absolute emissions target is announced (myopic behavior). The intensity target features stronger hedging.}
  \label{fig:sequencing}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=12cm]{figures/sequencing2.pdf}
  \caption{Optimal paths of the sequencing scenarios under uncertainty. The same graphs with each growth scenario plotted separately are found in Figure A7 of the Appendix.}
  \label{fig:sequencing2}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, contrary to the theoretical property stating that intensity targets lead to a slower decoupling of growth and emissions (Sue Wing et al. 2006), in our stochastic analysis---where hedging strategies against growth uncertainty are identified---we find that it is the intensity target that could lead to additional clean energy investment and thus faster reduction in emissions in China.


\subsubsection{How hedging strategies shape the sequencing}
The sequencing scenarios of the previous section show very different behavior depending on whether the intermediate target is an intensity or absolute target. We showed analytically that this is due to different incentives caused by each target. To quantify the differences, i.e. to identify hedging strategies, we need to go beyond the analytical approach. This happens because the analytical approach does not show us what the optimal strategy under growth uncertainty is, it simply tells us that the strategies will be different. With REMIND-S we are able to quantify the optimal hedging strategies dictated by the different incentives of the previous sections. 

The detailed analysis is found in Appendix \ref{ap:hedging} where we begin with a discussion of how hedging emerges in the first place (i.e. in the baseline case) and continue with an analysis of each climate target individually. We find that intensity targets favor a precautionary strategy (as seen by the strong hedging in Figure \ref{fig:sequencing}) while quantity targets favor a wait-and-see strategy (weak hedging). We also show that learning about uncertainty greatly reduces the target effect and leads to similar strategies for each target. We conclude with a discussion of how coal usage shapes the hedging in each case. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:figure8} optimal coal usage under uncertainty is larger in the absolute target case than in the intensity target case. Coal, in fact, is favored in a QUAN scenario under uncertainty even more than in the medium growth case. This results from the resource low price and is not the case for the other two important fossil energy sources, gas and oil. The above effects can only be captured with a detailed stochastic model like REMIND-S.

The different hedging strategies combined with the discontinuity of the sequencing provide the basis for the scenarios depicted in Figures \ref{fig:sequencing} and \ref{fig:sequencing2}, on which we base the multi-criteria comparison of targets in the following section.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/figure8.pdf}
  \caption{Optimal fossil resource usage under uncertainty compared to the scenario of full information. The quantity scenario features no uncertainty-driven decrease in coal consumption whereas oil and gas are reduced.}
  \label{fig:figure8}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Multi-criteria comparison of targets}

Climate targets, as policy objectives, need to be evaluated in terms of more than one property in order to meet political and social acceptance criteria. An example is that climate policy obviously will affect the environment (GHG concentration, air pollution, etc.), but it can also create winners and losers depending on which direction investment streams are directed. It can even be the reason why capacities are retired earlier than expected (due to unanticipated strengthening of policies), giving rise to sunk investments. Moreover, different target types can have completely different strategies as responses, e.g. a precautionary strategy can incentivise high investment in renewables early on, whereas a wait-and-see strategy can have the opposite effect. This will affect how costs are distributed over time. Furthermore, as targets will inevitably be sequential, the above mentioned effects will become more complex, as it is also the type of the second target and the time of its announcement that will play an important role. Lastly, the fact that economic growth can not be predicted with certainty already affects the baseline case (over- or under-investment), and this effect is strengthen in the presence of climate policy. 

Based on these implications and on the findings of the previous sections we compare intensity and quantity targets under several criteria. We choose four categories of criteria: the \textbf{environment}, economic \textbf{efficiency} (relating to costs of policies and their distribution over time), \textbf{disruptiveness} (relating to abrupt changes in the system caused by the announcement of targets) and \textbf{uncertainty reduction} (relating to how targets under growth uncertainty affect investors' optimal behavior). This way we formulate the problem of deciding which target is preferable for China using a multi-criteria comparison. This allows us to assess the relative attractiveness of targets for China under more criteria than simple welfare maximization. We use seven criteria, including three criteria that are used for the first time in the target comparison context. The classification of the criteria is as follows: We express environmental criteria in terms of GHG emissions. We measure target efficiency in terms of carbon taxes and welfare. As indicators addressing disruptiveness we use cost volatility and idle coal capacity. Finally, from an uncertainty reduction point of view, we rate the targets using as criteria non-optimal investment and Expected Value of Information (EVOI, see Table \ref{tab:tabNL} for a description of the EVOI). The criteria are summarized on Table \ref{tab:tabCRIT}, and explained in detail in the Appendix \ref{ap:indicators}. The newly introduced criteria are non-optimal investment, EVOI, idle coal capacity (already used by Kriegler and Bertram, applied here for the first time in the target comparison context), and cost volatility. The emissions criterion has been used by almost all authors in the target literature.

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{footnotesize}
\end{table}

In Figure \ref{fig:RplotSeg} we illustrate the multi-criteria comparison between a quantity and an intensity target taking into account target sequencing and growth uncertainty. The quantity target performs better in four out of seven cases, whereas intensity perfoms better in two. Regarding the criteria classification, an intensity target performs better in terms of the environment but the quantity target is more preferable under all the other categories, except for disruptiveness where each target performs better in one of the two criteria. We provide a discussion of individual values of the indicators in section \ref{sec:tsequencing}.

The overall effect of the quantity target performing better is a manifestation of the risk of realisation of the low growth scenario in the case of an intensity target, combined with the increase in climate policy costs that arise in the case of high growth under a quantity target, as explained above. REMIND-S captures these effects while taking into account all possible energy planning configurations, and derives the values of the comparison indicators.

Indicators are listed along the y-axis and their values are given on the x-axis as percentages relative to the baseline (BASE) or the medium-growth full-information scenario value (Q50-L10), for harmonization. A lower indicator value indicates a more positive effect, i.e. reduced risk. A quantity target performs better than an intensity target in 4 out of 7 cases. In one case there is no clear advantage for the one or the other type of target (EVOI).
Note: the baseline value is 100\% for the three upper indicators.

\section{Conclusions and Policy Implications} 

We perform an empirical study of China's climate policy to assess if its 2030 emission intensity target performs better than an absolute target in preparing the economy for a mid-century target, i.e. in a target sequencing situation.

First, we analyse the implications of comparing intensity and quantity targets in deterministic mode. China expects high growth, hence an intensity target was adopted (it provides cost containment in case of high growth). But this becomes problematic in the case of low growth as on top of stagnating growth increased climate policy costs will occur. In contrast, a quantity target has more costs than an intensity target in a high growth scenario, but may come at very low cost in the case of low growth. This means that each target has its advantages, but no single optimal strategy can be identified if future growth is uncertain. Additionally, the costs related to the choice of intensity vs. quantity target for China are of the same order in magnitude as climate policy itself. All the above motivate us to make use of a stochastic modelling framework, with which a single optimal path providing a strategy for all possible growth scenarios can be derived. 

In the main part of the results section we fully account for growth uncertainty and consider target sequencing. Under this scheme a quantity target for China performs better in our multi-criteria comparison. It features less costs and also reduces uncertainty, thereby leading to easier transition to low-carbon, e.g. with less idle capacities in the energy sector. As an explanation for the advantage of quantity over intensity we show analytically that the target type has a strong effect on how growth scenarios shape the optimal carbon price, i.e. different incentives for investment are generated for each target type. The analytic results enhance the robustness of the findings, as the form of the probability distribution describing the uncertainty does not play any role there. This comes without generalising, as the different incentives hold only when emission intensity decreases with economic growth, as is the case in China. Furthermore, we show numerically---by use of a stochastic model with large technological detail---that there is a precautionary hedging strategy dictated by the intensity target becoming more stringent in the low growth case, whereas quantity targets are hedged better with a wait-and-see strategy. The precautionary strategy is manifested in further reduction in coal usage---compared to the deterministic scenario---already in the first years, which leads to an early emissions reduction, whereas in the wait-and-see case coal is abated later, resulting in little further uncertainty-driven abatement in the short term.

\citet{ellerman_absolute_2003} suggest that intensity and quantity targets can be interchanged infinitely and eventually lead to the same costs and emissions (in a theoretical and perfectly flexible system). This is challenged here due to the fact that in reality target updating happens in time scales similar to energy investment cycles and power plant lifetimes, thus succession of different types of targets will generate distortions. This makes the case for an adoption of an intermediate quantity target being more suitable for China, as the long-term 2 \degree C target is also a quantity target.

We acknowledge that the absence of indicators relating to interaction with other countries (incentives, cooperation, etc.) in the analysis consitutes a limitation of our study. To capture this a stochastic model with regional interaction would be needed, which currently involves prohibitive computational burden.

\section{}
\subsection{The integrated assessment model REMIND}\label{ap:remind}

REMIND (REgional Model of INvestment and Developement) is a multi-sector, multi-region integrated assessment model used for global climate policy analysis \citep{luderer_description_2015}. REMIND has been used extensively in IPCC reports, e.g. \citet{ipcc_climate_2014} and \citet{ipcc_global_2018}, and major model intercomparison projects, e.g. \citet{kriegler_role_2014}, \citet{pietzcker_system_2017}, \citet{bauer_global_2018}, \citet{luderer_residual_2018}, \citet{riahi_shared_2017}. It combines a top-down Ramsey-type growth model with a bottom-up energy system model of large technological detail. In the macro-economic core of REMIND, aggregated and discounted intertemporal welfare is maximized for a number of regions spanning the whole globe, while pathways are derived for savings and investments, factor incomes, as well as energy and material demand. The utility function of REMIND exhibits constant relative risk aversion and has logarithmic form. Regions interact by trade in primary energy carriers, emission permits, and a composite good. The detailed representation of the energy system in each region consists of capital stocks for more than 60 technologies for energy conversion, including technologies that are able to generate negative emissions, like bioenergy combined with carbon capture and sequestration.

In REMIND, economic activity results in demand for energy services, which in turn results in GHG emissions from extraction and burning of fossil fuels in different sectors (buildings, industry, transport) and levels (primary, secondary, and final energy). Mitigation scenarios analyze optimal strategies for decarbonization with the use of a carbon tax applied on the economy, resulting in a shift from fossil use to renewable energy. A full portfolio of GHG is considered (CO\textsubscript{2}, CH4, N2O, NH3, F-gases, etc.), either via emissions from energy use or via exogenous marginal abatement cost curves (e.g. land-use). Adjustment costs in energy investment and deployment account for policy realism and path dependency. REMIND usually runs in so-called cost-effectiveness mode, not internalizing potential economic damages of climate change, but rather analyzing energy technology portfolios and investment dynamics under given climate targets (GHG budgets, reduction relative to a baseline, carbon taxes, etc.)


\subsection{Decision-making under uncertainty in energy-economy models --- Description of the REMIND-S model}\label{ap:reminds}

There are several approaches in the literature to tackle uncertainty in climate policy analysis, reviewed extensively by \citet{golub_uncertainty_2014}, \citet{traeger_recent_2009}, \citet{kann_approaches_2000}, \citet{heal_uncertainty_2014}, \citet{heal_uncertainty_2002}, \citet{peterson_uncertainty_2005}, and \citet{baker_uncertainty_2008}. In energy-economy models, the first approach is called uncertainty propagation, and includes the methods of scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis. Although as methods they do not derive unique optimal decision paths, they provide important means for the design of climate policy. They do so by thoroughly exploring the scenario space and deriving detailed insights for each case, and by identifying which parameters contribute the most to uncertainty. A recent application of scenario analysis in the context of climate change is the concept of the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs, \citet{oneill_new_2014}), where self-consistent scenarios for the most important socio-economic drivers (population and economic growth, etc.) were developed for the future and a big body of studies was carried out shedding light in the implications of these socio-economic drivers for energy and land-use, emissions, climate change and mitigation of climate change (\citet{riahi_shared_2017}, \citet{kriegler_fossil-fueled_2017}). In other applications, \citet{marangoni_sensitivity_2017} use a sophisticated sensitivity analysis method to test various different parameters influencing emissions projections in the context of the SSPs, and conclude that economic growth and energy intensity are the most important drivers of uncertainty. 

As a second approach to uncertainty, methods performing decision-making under uncertainty are used. These include analyses using real option analysis \citep{anda_economics_2009} and stochastic modelling, e.g. the methods of discrete stochastic programming and dynamic stochastic programming. \citet{jensen_optimal_2014} provide detailed estimates of optimal carbon taxes under long-term economic growth uncertainty using a dynamic stochastic integrated assessment model. [...]

The model REMIND-S (REMIND-Stochastic) is presented here for the first time. It is the version of REMIND (see \ref{ap:remind}) that explicitly accounts for uncertainty in one or more parameters. REMIND-S solves a Discrete Stochastic Programming (DSP) problem. DSP is a common method to explicitly account for uncertainty in integrated assessment models of climate change. It is widely used due to its moderate computational cost and useful insights, as well as the fact that it provides means for inclusion of stochasticity and multi-stage decision modelling. The key concept of DSP is to allow for the identification of one single optimal strategy under uncertainty (illustrated on the right panel of Fig. \ref{fig:uncoverview}), as opposed to multiple state-dependent optimal paths in a learn-then-act framework which can be explored by standard Monte Carlo, or simple scenario analysis (left panel of Fig. \ref{fig:uncoverview}). Thus, in DSP, the decision maker is exposed to a range of values of the uncertain parameter(s) in different "states-of-the-world" (realizations of the uncertain parameter), and still derives a single optimal path. The range of values of the uncertain parameter is described by a probability distribution running over the full set of states-of-the-world. This probability distribution can take any form and this is what gives the method the characterization "stochastic". REMIND-S features the exact same technological and sectoral detail as REMIND (the same holds for the rest of the model structure), but in REMIND-S expected utility is maximized, i.e. the weighted sum of utilities in each state-of-the-world, using the probabilities as weights, see equations describing the No-Learn and Act-Then-Learn cases in Fig. \ref{fig:uncoverview}. Thus, each state-of-the-world of REMIND-S is actually an instance of REMIND with different values for the uncertain parameters.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=15cm]{figures/uncoverview.pdf}
  \caption{Schematic representation of the various levels of uncertainty consideration applied here, and the respective objective functions. E is the expected value operator, $U$ is the utility, $s$ stands for state-of-the-world, $I$ are the investment decisions, $\theta$ is the uncertain parameter, and $m$ a message containing information about $\theta$. "Learning" refers to the point in time where the message $m$ is received. Hedging is defined as the decision path that responds to uncertainty, driven by the decision maker's risk aversion, see also Appendix A2.}
  \label{fig:uncoverview}
\end{figure}

As mentioned above, the main feature of DSP is deriving a single optimal strategy under uncertainty. But capturing one single decision path poses a challenge in a complex model like REMIND-S, where various different investments and choices can be made. Thus, in REMIND-S, energy investments, fossil extraction rates and trade, as well early retired capacities are equalized across the states-of-the-world by use of special constraints, which leads to equal emissions across the states-of-the-world; this is what is defined as one single optimal strategy. The presence of these constraints in an expected utility optimization framework gives rise to hedging strategies (the red arrows of Fig. \ref{fig:uncoverview} show where the hedging takes place), as the best compromise between conflicting optimal decisions in each state-of-the-world is sought after. This happens before uncertainty is resolved (learning point of Fig. \ref{fig:uncoverview}), as the decision maker should be unaware of the state-of-the-world that will materialize. After the learning point the constraints are fully relaxed so that decisions can be tailored to individual growth scenarios, and emissions differ across the different states-of-the-world.

Risk aversion is described by the elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS), which describes also the decision maker's preference towards intertemporal equality, as we do not consider separate preferences (this would require a different type of modelling, as intertemporal optimization cannot be easily combined with separate preferences). In REMIND-S, EIS is equal to unity, giving the utility function its logarithmic form with diminishing returns of consumption, see \ref{ap:remind}.


\subsection{Uncertainty scenarios}\label{ap:uncscen}

A schematic of the approaches to uncertainty considered here is given in Figure \ref{fig:uncoverview}. First, the best-guess (BG) case is the situation where---given an uncertain parameter $\theta$ described by a known probability distribution---an optimal decision path can be derived under complete information using the best-guess value of $\theta$, $\textbf{E}(\theta)$, where $\textbf{E}$ is the expected value operator. With "decision path" we refer to optimal macro-economic investments and energy planning configurations (see 4.1 for the definition of energy planning). The second case of Figure \ref{fig:uncoverview}, learn-then-act (LTA), describes a counterfactual, where uncertainty about $\theta$ is completely resolved before energy planning is performed, thus it can be fully adapted to each state-of-the-world (a "state-of-the-world" describes one realization of $\theta$). Third, act-then-learn (ATL) is the case where all $\theta$ values remain possible and the decision path takes into account all of them at once. But the decision makers will eventually learn or be able to make better assumptions about the uncertain parameter; at a certain point in time uncertainty is resolved and the decisions after that point can be tailored to the individual messages received. Last, no-learn (NL) is a special case of ATL where learning never happens and decisions are taken under uncertainty throughout the time horizon.

Labor productivity is $\theta$ in our case. The high and low labor productivity scenarios together with the BG scenario define the three learn-then-act (LTA) scenarios, see Figure \ref{fig:uncoverview}. Scenario analysis (left panel in Figure \ref{fig:uncoverview}), delivers more than one optimal decision paths, one for each value of the uncertain parameter. To derive a unique optimal path, one needs to take into account all possible values of the uncertain parameter at the same time. REMIND-S, the model used in this study, solves a discrete stochastic programming problem with three different states-of-the-world capturing the three different assumptions about labor productivity. The decision is optimized taking all states-of-the-world into account (right panel in Figure \ref{fig:uncoverview}), as well as all the components of energy planning. The latter cannot be captured by a simple stochastic growth model, as these lack the energy system detail provided by REMIND-S. The use of a stochastic version of a large and very detailed integrated assessment model helps better assess the risks associated with the realization of the growth scenarios. In REMIND-S, decision variables are investments into a macro-economic capital stock and energy planning decisions. In our application, the former decisions always adapt to the actual realization of labor productivity in a given state-of-the-world (assuming well functioning capital markets), while the latter decisions apply to all three states-of-the-world, characterizing a forward planning process in the energy sector that needs to take into account expectations about future economic growth. By use of this model we perform decision-making under uncertainty, under the above mentioned ATL and NL scenarios, differentiated by the existence or not of a learning step (an intrinsic feature of uncertainty analysis). See the Appendix A2 for a detailed description of REMIND-S.

We assign equal probabilities to the BG, High-, and Low-growth scenarios throughout the analysis. The equal probabilities and the 25\% higher and lower variation result in a symmetrical probability distribution. This makes the BG case a special case of LTA, see also Table 1. 



\subsection{How to hedge against growth uncertainty}\label{ap:hedging}

We start with hedging in the baseline case and continue with hedging in the presence of climate targets and how it is affected by learning about uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Hedging in the absence of climate policy}

Hedging is defined as the deviation of the single optimal decision path---produced under NL and ATL---when compared with the best-guess case. But why does hedging appear in the first place, i.e. why is the single optimal path in NL and ATL not simply the mean value between the states-of-the-world (i.e. the best-guess result in the case of a symmetrical probability distribution, like in this study)? The latter can be easily obtained by a simple scenario analysis, without stochasticity. In mathematical form, it holds (using the same notation as in Figure A1):


\begin{equation}
\text{arg }\!\!\max\limits_{I} \textbf{E}[U(\theta)]\quad \neq \quad\text{arg }\!\!\max\limits_{I_{BG}}U[\textbf{E}(\theta)]
\end{equation}

To answer this question we look into how uncertainty affects optimal investments. Uncertainty in economic growth leads to changes in optimal investment decisions already in the baseline case, in investments in the macroeconomic capital stock as well as energy investments. These changes occur while seeking one single energy investment path, i.e. the best compromise between all the possible growth scenarios (only one is allowed in NL and in prior-to-learn ATL because decisions can not be tailored to individual growth scenarios), when the decision maker necessarily ends up with a trajectory that lies somewhere between the optimal paths of the LTA case. This is the solution that includes the lowest sacrifice: the least possible overinvestment in case a low growth scenario realizes, the least possible underinvestment in case a high growth scenario realizes, and, if possible, neither overinvestment nor underinvestment in case the best-guess growth realizes. Indeed, as seen in Figure A2 the overall result is an investment path (grey line) that lies between the High- and Low-growth scenarios, but lower than the best-guess path (black line), as the effect of uncertainty does not propagate linearly through the growth scenarios, see Equation A1. More specific, if optimal investments were to lie above the best-guess case and a low growth scenario materialized, this suboptimality turns out to be more expensive than if the investments lie under the best-guess case, because in the high growth case the society is wealthier.

Furthermore, as seen in Figure A3, the per cent reductions in optimal energy technology investments under uncertainty are not the same for each technology, showing a) energy-specific robust strategies in the baseline, and b) highlighting the necessity to use a technology-rich model for the present analysis.

  \caption{Variation in the optimal use of key energy sources between the best-guess and the no-learn case (without climate policy). Per cent reduction is not the same for all energy types.}
  \label{fig:baseunc}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Intensity targets lead to a precautionary strategy}

Hedging is based on the same principle as in the previous section, but unfolds differently in the case of a 2030 climate target under complete growth uncertainty (NL). In the intensity target case, NL-T30I, the low growth scenario poses a challenge for the economy if realized, as the indexed target becomes more stringent if GDP grows slowly, see Figure 4 of the main text. The dominance of the low growth scenario leads to the hedging strategy of further reducing emissions when going from BG to NL, see Figure A4, describing a precautionary strategy. This happens via increased renewable energy investment---alongside increased energy investment---compared to the NL-T30Q case, see Figure A5 for a comparison of energy investment strategies. 

In NL-T30Q, the hedging strategy differs substantially; now the high growth scenario poses a challenge (due to high policy costs in the case of a fixed target, see Figure 4) and the least-cost possible energy system in the presence of the short-term 2030 target is one characterized by moderate energy investment (Figure A5), pointing to a wait-and-see strategy (no hedging in emissions, see Figure A4). This is reflected also in the average price paid for energy, as seen in Figure A5, the NL-T30Q case featuring a lower price as NL-T30I.

An illustration of how coal\footnote{The power sector plays an important role in the transition to low-carbon economy. In China this sector is dominated by coal.} shapes this strategy is shown in Figure A6, where it is seen that until 2020 optimal coal usage follows a similar path as the best-guess strategy in the NL case, only to be reduced in the case where learning is considered. Finally, in the T30I no-learn case, reduced coal compared to BG is what mostly drives reduction in emissions, as seen on the same figure. Ultimately, early learning about uncertainty reduces the importance of target choice and leads to almost the same amount of uncertainty-driven emissions reduction for a quantity and an intensity target.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/emiunc.pdf}
  \caption{Hedging (defined as the deviation from the BG line) in emissions in the NL and ATL scenarios for stand-alone 2030 targets. Hedging in NL is given by the difference between circles and triangles and is much stronger in the case of an intensity target (dark green vs. orange dashed lines), but is almost equalized when learning in 2020 is considered (squares in 2020). The separate ATL paths after 2020 exist because energy planning can adapt to individual growth scenarios only after the learning point. For simplicity, "T30" has been removed from the scenario names.}
  \label{fig:emiunc}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{figures/priceinvunc.pdf}
  \caption{Left: Energy is cheaper in the case of a quantity target, as a result of a wait-and-see strategy. Right: Optimal energy investments increase under uncertainty in the intensity target case, but decrease for a quantity target.}
  \label{fig:priceinvunc}
\end{figure}

When learning is considered in the analysis (ATL), more hedging takes place in the T30Q case, as the available information after 2020 allows for the energy planner to respond to the upcoming target in 2030 individually, thus increasing investment and subsequently, welfare, see Figure A3 and Table A3 (more on this in the next paragraph). All the T30Q scenarios meet the 13.4 Gt target in 2030, except for the ATL-Low scenario, where the target is not binding, because overinvestment prior to the learning point combined with low growth result in a pathway with emission reductions stronger than what the target dictates. Overall, we see that learning eliminates to a great extend the difference between a T30Q and a T30I target.

The welfare losses due to uncertainty, measured in \emph{certainty- and balanced-growth equivalents} (CBGE), sum up to 4.1 per cent of net present value of total consumption, see the Appendix A4 for a detailed definition of the CBGE. This is called expected value of perfect information (EVOPI), and is reduced when learning is considered, as seen on Table A3. The associated metric is called expected value of information (EVOI). This shows that with reduced uncertainty (learning), the target type choice plays less of an important role in the decision-making process.

\begin{table}[]
\caption{Effect of uncertainty and target type on welfare (expressed as as per cent changes in aggregate policy costs and measured in \emph{certainty-equivalent balanced growth equivalents; ΔCBGE}): In the left column, a comparison of policy costs until 2030 between the learn-then-act and the NL/ATL scenarios is shown. We see that learning about uncertainties increases welfare significantly (difference between Expected Value of Perfect Information; EVOPI, and Expected Value of Information; EVOI), and quantity targets can generate less costs than intensity targets. In the far right column, as reference, we show the corresponding climate policy costs until 2030, i.e. NL-Base vs. NL-T30, and ATL-Base vs. ATL-T30.}

\subsection{Policy costs measured in balanced growth equivalents}\label{ap:bge}     %% Appendix A1, A2, etc.

Climate policy costs in integrated assessment models are usually formulated in terms of relative differences in intertemporal, aggregated, and discounted consumption (or GDP) between cases with and without policy. When comparing climate policy costs across different baselines, as happens here where different growth scenarios are considered, this method of comparison fails to capture the welfare effects correctly, as for each case one ends up using a different yardstick. A measure that is more adequate is the \emph{balanced growth equivalent} (BGE), which describes the amount of today's consumption, that, when extended into the future with a growth rate $\alpha$, results in the same amount of utility $U$ as the scenario in question. In mathematical form the BGE is the solution of the following equation with respect to $\gamma$:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{t=0}^{T} U[\gamma(\omega)(1+\alpha)^t]P_t(1+\rho)^{-t} =W(\omega)
\end{equation}

where $\omega$ is the policy in question, $P$ is population, $t$ is the time and $T$ the time horizon, $\rho$ is the discount rate and $W$ is the welfare. For a standard constant relative risk aversion utility function we get:


\begin{equation}
\gamma(\omega) =[(1-\eta)W(\omega)]^{\frac{1}{1-\eta}}\Big[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{(1+\alpha)^{t(1-\eta)}P_t}{(1+\rho)^t}\Big]^{-\frac{1}{1-\eta}}\text{ , for } \eta \neq 0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\gamma(\omega) =\exp\Big(\frac{W(\omega)-\ln(1+\alpha)\sum_{t=0}^{T} tP_t(1+\rho)^{-t}}{\sum_{t=0}^{T} P_t(1+\rho)^{-t}}\Big)\text{ , for } \eta = 0
\end{equation}
% \[\gamma(\omega) = \left\{
%     \begin{array}{lr}
%       [(1-\eta)W(\omega)]^{\frac{1}{1-\eta}}[\sum_{t=0}^{T} \frac{(1+\alpha)^{t(1-\eta)}P_t}{(1+\rho)^t}]^{-\frac{1}{1-\eta}} & \text{for } \eta \neq 0\\
%       \exp\Big(\frac{W(\omega)-\ln(1+\alpha)\sum_{t=0}^{T} tP_t(1+\rho)^{-t}}{\sum_{t=0}^{T} P_t(1+\rho)^{-t}}\Big) & \text{for } \eta = 0
%     \end{array}
%   \right.
% \]

where $\eta$ is the intertemporal elasticity of consumption.

Using the BGE relative differences between scenarios with different baselines are easily and intuitively comparable. For scenarios where expected utility is maximized the \emph{certainty- and balanced-growth equivalent} is defined as the expected value of the BGE and used as adequate policy measure:

\begin{equation}
\text{CEBGE}\equiv\textbf{E}(\text{BGE})=\sum_{i=1}^{s} \text{BGE}_ip_i
\end{equation}



\subsection{Description of target rating criteria}\label{ap:indicators}

We discuss the relative attractiveness of sequential intensity and quantity targets in terms of the criteria listed below (the respective categories are provided in brackets). In all the indicators a lower value demonstrates a more positive effect. The expected value, i.e. the average between the three possible growth scenarios is taken for the calculation of all indicator values. The medium-growth full-information and baseline scenarios---with which we normalize---feature full information about growth, full target anticipation and no intermediate target. For plots of the indicators see Figure 6. For a detailed view of the optimal paths in each state-of-the-world see Figure A7.

\textbf{GHG emissions [Environmental]}

We describe the emissions indicator in terms of the total amount of additional GHG emissions on top of the medium-growth full-information scenario emissions emitted by each target scenario until 2050. Thus, a negative value means a scenario features more emissions abatement than the above scenario. The indicator is harmonized with the cumulated medium-growth full-information GHG emissions reduction from the baseline in the period 2005-2050, thus this scenario has a value of 0 and the baseline has a value of 100\%. 

\textbf{Carbon price [Efficiency]}

The size of the carbon tax that has to be exerted on the economy for the target to be met. To account for time variability we take the net present value in 2015 (discounted at 5\%) of the tax path until 2050, and express the indicator as percentage of the medium-growth full-information case.


\textbf{Welfare loss [Efficiency]}

The welfare loss indicator measures which target features a smaller reduction of social welfare against the baseline in the period 2005-2050, relative to the reduction of the best-guess path. Thus BG has a value of 100\%. We use BGE values in 2050 in order to account for baseline variability, see Appendix A4.  


\textbf{Cost volatility [Disruptiveness]} 

The sequencing scenarios with unanticipated announcement of the 2050 target, exhibit a myopic behavior which can lead to jumps in costs. To capture these we calculate the difference in the carbon tax across the various growth scenarios in the time before and after the target announcement (2030). Since each growth scenario has an independent carbon tax, we take the expected value of the differences for each scenario in order to derive the cost volatility indicator.


\textbf{Idle coal capacity [Disruptiveness]}

Expected retired coal capacity in the power sector (i.e. capacity that has not reached the end of its lifetime). To take into account also the years a power plant would spent in idle mode, we aggregate over time. The indicator is normalized with the best-guess scenario value.


\textbf{Non-optimal investment [Uncertainty reduction]}

Acting under uncertainty necessarily leads to a suboptimal allocation of resources, as explained in 5.2.1. Thus, prior to the learning point, energy investment will be suboptimal. We measure this suboptimality by comparing the absolute difference between the net present value (with a discount rate of 5\%) of the total energy investment of the period 2010-2030, i.e. up to the the learning point, in the best-guess case and each target scenario. Thus, BG has a zero value by definition, and we scale with the baseline value, see Figure 6.


\textbf{Expected Value of Information [Uncertainty reduction]}

Describes the value---in terms of welfare gains---of learning about growth uncertainty in 2030, i.e. it compares the BGE of the I30Q50-L30 and Q30Q50-L30 scenarios with scenarios with no learning (I30Q50-NoL and Q30Q50-NoL)
